# SNN
This is a implementation of Spiking Neurons which learns from spike time dependent plasticity(STDP). Unlike backpropogation, STDP is unsupervised learning mechanism. We design Integrate and fire neurons, perform spike propogation and finally backpropogation is replaced by STDP learning mechanism.  
Pending Work:
1. Integrate Frequency Encoding - Chris - COMPLETE
2. Implement STDP - Chris/Adisree/ Rajiv
3. Spike Prop - Rajiv
4. Histograms of the outputs of the neurons
